### Introduction
“Own only what you can always carry with you: known languages, known countries, known people. Let your memory be your travel bag." — Alexandr Solzhenitsyn </br> <br>
This fascinating quote by Alexandr Solzhenitsyn represents the mindset of a digital nomad. Digital nomads are people who travel freely while working remotely using technology and the internet. While travelling, digital nomads tend to understand the culture and the environment, giving them opportunities to understand the world’s diversity and handle software projects at the same time. <br> <br>
As a developer of RemoteVibe.inc, I researched the different constraints that digital nomads face. In fact, I had an interview session with one such person who has lived in 4 countries in her 1.5 years of being a digital nomad. During the interview, he mentioned that learning about the famous places in real time is an experience, but doing so and working becomes a problem because not only places offer smooth internet and efficient technologies. Many places do not have the right requirements that digital nomads need for their work. So, it is a necessity, as an organisation, to come up with a product that can overcome these constraints and fulfil their needs. <br> <br>
This project will provide a solution in the form of a prototype that fulfils every digital nomad's requirements and makes their work-travel time highly efficient.

### Problem Definition
In the rapidly growing community of digital nomads, several challenges hinder productivity, learning, and overall well-being, leading to reduced effectiveness and poor quality of work. These challenges include: </br> <br>
1. Language Learning Inefficiency: According to a study by the Education Data Initiative, 70% of digital nomads find it difficult to learn a new language despite the necessity to communicate effectively while traveling. Only 40% of these individuals engage in language learning consistently, with a significant portion citing lack of structured time, motivation, and suitable resources. </br> <br>
2. Inefficient Co-working Sessions: Research by WeWork suggests that 65% of digital nomads report inefficient co-working experiences. These include poor collaboration, distractions, and lack of proper resources. The inefficiencies in co-working spaces lead to a decrease in overall productivity, as 55% of nomads express frustration over inconsistent or low-quality work environments. </br> <br>
3. Unreliable Internet Connections: A global survey by Nomad List reveals that 60% of digital nomads struggle with bad internet access, with unreliable Wi-Fi being a major barrier. This can lead to disrupted work sessions, delayed communication, and hindered collaboration, causing significant stress and work delays. Approximately 45% report that internet connectivity issues directly impact their ability to meet deadlines. </br> <br>
4. Poor Password Management: As digital nomads frequently use multiple platforms and services, password management becomes a major concern. A LastPass report indicates that 59% of remote workers use the same password across multiple sites, and 50% struggle to securely store and manage passwords. This vulnerability increases the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks, which threaten the security of sensitive work and personal information. </br> <br>
5. Lack of Focus and Unproductive Time: A study by RescueTime shows that 80% of digital nomads face difficulty staying focused, with distractions from social media, poor time management, or unstructured routines contributing to a significant amount of wasted time. On average, they report up to 3 hours of non-productive time each day due to these factors, leading to lower productivity and burnout. </br> <br>

I have also published a survey form to understand the problems that digital nomads are facing today. Here is the forms link and the responses link: - <br>

Looking at the statistics, I feel that these constraints must be taken into deep consideration and addressed so that the digital nomads can have a smooth work experience wherever they travel.

### Goal
To empower digital nomads to work more efficiently and securely while maintaining focus and continuous personal development.
### Objective
To develop an application that provides digital nomads password management, efficient coworking sessions, information about the nearest internet cafes, and many more features that enhance their travel and work experience.

### Existing projects
1. AirBNB (Travel App): [https://www.airbnb.co.in/](https://www.airbnb.co.in/) <br>
2. Notion (Productivity App): [https://www.notion.com/](https://www.notion.com/) <br>
3. Nomad eSIM (Digital Connectivity App): [https://www.getnomad.app/](https://www.getnomad.app/) <br>
4. Revolut (App for Finance): [https://www.revolut.com/](https://www.revolut.com/)

### Approach
Here is how the following steps guided me to the formation of Nomad Nest: - </br>
#### 1. Brainstorming:
• Gamified Language Learning Integration: Consider adding gamification elements to the language learning feature, such as daily challenges, streaks, and rewards. This could improve motivation and engagement for users who struggle with consistency in learning a new language. <br>
• Offline Functionality for Key Features: Enable offline access for critical app features like language practice modules or productivity tools. This would help digital nomads stay productive even in areas with unreliable internet connections. <br>
• Community and Collaboration Hub: Integrate a community feature where digital nomads can connect with each other, share tips for co-working spaces, and collaborate on projects. This could improve co-working experiences and foster a sense of belonging. <br>
• Cafe Finder for Productivity: Introduce a Cafe Finder feature that suggests cafes nearby with ratings for Wi-Fi quality, noise levels, seating comfort, and availability of power outlets. This can help digital nomads find the perfect spot to work efficiently while enjoying a good ambiance. <br>
Here is a SCAMPER board to understand how the app idea is distributed based on 7 different categories shown in the picture: - <br>

(Figure 1: - SCAMPER Board to understand the app's vision in 7 categories)

#### 2. Developing the Mindset:
Keeping the foot in the user’s shoe creates a mindset that digital nomads follow. As the project leader for this problem, I must think and find innovative solutions for them so that they find the idea creative and usable on a daily basis. Here is a table that includes the constraint, designs and features that can overcome them, and a creative perspective on it: - <br> <br>

### Screenshots of the Output
(Note that the probabilities of the poses are not dependent on each other) <br>
1. Standing Threshold Probability: 5 % <br>
2. Sitting Threshold Probability: 90 % <br>
3. Faint Threshold Probability: 85 % <br>
(The model must detect a value greater than these threshold values to detect the respective pose) <br> <br>

### Monitoring and Maintenance
Now that we have deployed the model, it is to be monitored to prevent false alarms and continuously update the training data to increase accuracy. Once we get a deeper understanding about advanced computer vision, I would continue to integrate this model with hardware devices to make it a fully functional product. Monitoring this model will prevent any issues arising in the code.
### Limitations
• Can only send a WhatsApp message as Twilio requires a subscription for calling services <br>
• Not much detailed feature extraction and limited to only one person at a time <br>
• Cannot completely differentiate between sleeping and fainting.
### Benefits
• Provides additional safety for individuals prone to fainting, such as those with certain medical conditions, elderly individuals, or people recovering from surgeries. <br>
• Offers around-the-clock monitoring without requiring the constant presence of a caregiver, making it ideal for home or assisted-living environments.
• Provides last recorded heart beat so that doctors can find out the cause of the faint easily.
### Future Scope
This system can be made much better by introducing it in the public surveillance cameras as well as improving and adding new features to the vital systems so that the camera provides the accurate recorded vitals when the person has fainted. Along with this, immediate ambulance services and increased accuracy can make the project better. 

### Conclusion
While coding this faint detection system, I learnt about how Python can be used to code computer vision applications to create systems for fulfilling basic necessities in society. I also learnt about how to provide a proper dataset as all the videos were put in a list. So, the best videos were found by surfing through the internet. <br>
Coding with different libraries like Mediapipe and Scikit Learn helped me understand advanced computer vision techniques and how to implement them with machine learning. Along with this, researching about the colour channels and different methods led to the creation of a heart rate detection system that I felt was not possible to do without any sensors. The use of photoplethysmography helped me integrate the use of vitals in my faint detection system. Finally, the discussion with peers, family members, and my teachers not only developed my communication skills, but they also gave me ideas and suggestions on how I can make my faint detection system better.
